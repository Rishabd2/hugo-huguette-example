A simple *boilerplate* theme for Hugo. Huguette contains no javascript. No CSS framework. 
You can use it without any css, or enable classless.css from settings and copying in one file (included in this repository). You can also optionally enable Netlify CMS. \
\
Developers new to Hugo will love it because there's no bells and whistles included that take away your attention from learning how Hugo works. I included just a few partials and page types to give an idea of what's possible.

Bloggers with no interest in developing websites will like the inclusion of Netlify CMS. Just install the theme, enable the css and Netlify CMS options in Hugo's config.toml, and they're good to go.

Just include Huguette as a git submodule like any other Hugo theme. Or use the links below for a more thorough explanation. The code includes an example site to get you up and running and demonstrate how Hugo and NetlifyCMS work together.
