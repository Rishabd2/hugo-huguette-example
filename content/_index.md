## About Huguette
Shield is an important project. 

I am a cloud engineer by day, and a hobbyist website builder whenever I have the time. I like to try lots of different technologies, just for the fun of it. 
Often, I miss a very simple boilerplate theme that just demonstrates what a CMS or site builder can do. Either you have to take your pick from the many (and often excellent!) beautiful themes with lots of bells and whistles that obscure a bit how everything works, or you have to start from scratch.

When I ran into Hugo, I decided to actually make such a simple theme. Without bells an whistles, no javascript, no npm or yarn needed to make changes to the theme. Just plain HTML. And to make it look better, I included classless.css. But using that is entirely optional (it does look good though!). I included a few, just enough, _Hugo partials_ in the theme to give you an idea of what they can do, nothing more. I really had to sit on my hands there :)

## Get Huguette
Huguette comes in two flavors: just the theme, or a simple one-click install that will give you a brand new site with the theme, the css and Netlify CMS enabled, hosted on Netlify. Just take your pick below.
