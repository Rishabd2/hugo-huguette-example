title: "The easy option: One-click install to Netlify"
introduction: |
  Yes it's that easy. Click the button, connect Netlify to Github and that's it!
---
## Just click this button and Netlify does the rest

[![Deploy with Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/cathelijne/hugo-huguette-example&stack=cms)

After clicking the button above, authenticate with GitHub or GitLab and choose a repository name. Netlify then automatically creates a clone of the repository in your GitHub or GitLab account. Next, it builds and deploys the new site on Netlify, bringing you to the site dashboard after completing the build.

### Access Netlify CMS on your new site
The template deploy process sends you an invitation to your new site, sent from no-reply@netlify.com. The subject line looks like this: _You've been invited to join radiologist-amanda-53841.netlify.com_

1. Wait for the deployment to complete, then click the link to accept the invite. Your site will open with a prompt to create a password.
2. Enter a password, sign in, and youâ€™ll go to the CMS. (For future visits, you can go straight to <yoursiteaddress.com>/admin/.)

Try adding and editing posts, or changing the content of the Products page. When you save, the changes are pushed immediately to your Git repository, triggering a build on Netlify, and updating the content on your site. Check out the configuration code by visiting your site repo.
